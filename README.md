#### Renato F S Júnior. Software Engineer. I'm currently an iOS Developer at [idwall](https://idwall.co/) 🧱💻

- 🔭 I'm working hard to improve my coding skills, focusing in Algorithms and Data Structures, Clean Code, SOLID and Architecture Patterns. 
- 🌱 Also currently learning C, Swift/iOS, Python, and The All Mighty Linux 🐧.
- ⚡ Fun facts: Although I enjoy to invest hours coding, I like a lot to play soccer (for the record I'm better than Neymar Jr, Messi or CR7); Also like to just go out and do some street running in a very Forest Gump way 🏃‍♂️.
