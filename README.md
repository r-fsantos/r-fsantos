- 🔭 I'm working hard to improve my coding skills, focusing in Algorithms and Data Structures, Clean Code, SOLID and Architecture Patterns. 
- 🌱 Also currently learning C, Swift/iOS, Python, and The All Mighty Linux 🐧.
- 🧑‍🎓 Taking the 42Cursus | Software Engineering at [42SP](https://www.42sp.org.br) | [42Network](https://42.fr/en/network-42/).
- ⚡ Fun facts: Although I enjoy to invest hours coding, I like a lot to play soccer (for the record I'm better than Neymar Jr, Messi and CR7 all together); Also like to just go out and do some street running in a very Forest Gump way 🏃‍♂️.
